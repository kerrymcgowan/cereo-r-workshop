  This is an abstract.
  
  It consists of 2 paragraphs.
output: html_document

The above text is called a YAML header.

Set up defalts for all chunks in document, `<include=FALSE>` means it won't show up in final HTML. `<echo=FALSE>` means code won't appear by default. "Global" means it will be applied to entire Markdown.
```{r global, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center')

library(tidyverse)
```



# Header 1
Biggest, RMarkdown format

<h1>Header 1</h1>
Biggest, HTML format

## Header 2
Big

### Header 3
Pretty big

#### Header 4
Bold header line

# Intro to Markdown Syntax
#### No line breaks
Here is an example of **bold** text. Another example of __bold__.
Here is an example of *italic* text. Another example of _italic_.
Here is an example of ***bold italic***.
What about superscript? x^2^
What about subscript? x~2~
Underlining text in RMarkdown isn't advised. When we incorporate URLs, those links show up as being underlined. <u>But here is how to do it in HTML.</u>
~~Underlined text~~ = no!

#### No difference
Here is an example of **bold** text. Another example of __bold__. Here is an example of *italic* text. Another example of _italic_. Here is an example of ***bold italic***. What about superscript? x^2^ What about subscript? x~2~ Underlining text in RMarkdown isn't advised. When we incorporate URLs, those links show up as being underlined. <u>But here is how to do it in HTML.</u> ~~Underlined text~~ = no!

#### Line breaks

<!-- Commented line --> Ctrl+Shift+C

Hidden line break (two spaces):  
Line 1  
Line 2

Obvious way (break escape): <br>
Line 1 <br>
Line 2

\* Note: that `<br>` does a line break and not a new paragraph. Enclosed in back ticks.

#### Body of document

This is our report introduction and we want to include supporting information in the form of a blockquote from an important person in our field.

> This is a quote from an important person.
> 
> This person is ***really*** important.
>
>> This will nest a quote.
>

Paragraph 2

Paragraph 3

#### Lists

A numbered list

  1. item 1
  2. item 2
  3. item 3

A symbol list, doesn't matter what symbol you use

  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3
  
  + item 1
  + item 2
  + item 3
  
  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

A list with a sublist 

  1. item 1
      i. subitem 1
  2. item 2
      ii. subitem 2
  3. item 3
      iii. subitem 3

> This is my **super** important list
> 
> 1. item 1
> 2. item 2
> 3. item 3

Paragraphs or descriptions under list items

1. Item 1

    This is a description for item 1. Requires 2 tabs in.
  
2. Item 2

    This is a description for item 2.
    
3. Item 3

    This is a description for item 3.
    
#### Tables in Markdown

   Col 1       Col 2        Col 3        Col 4
--------       --------  ----------      -----
       1        1             1           1
      12        12            12          12
     123        123           123         123

Table: Demonstration of a messy table.

 Col 1        Col 2      Col 3        Col 4
--------    --------    --------    --------
       1       1           1           1

Table: Demonstration of a clean table.
    
#### Links and graphics

Let's say we want to include a **link** to another source of information. We can easily do that by including the link. <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html> or we can include hyperlinks with [link](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

Let's include a graphic!

![A cool graphic](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/hex-rmarkdown.png)

That's WAY too big.

![A cool graphic](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/hex-rmarkdown.png){width=25%}

# Code chunks in Markdown

Also another way to include a graphic, echo hides the code and only shows the graphic <br>
`<include=FALSE>` wouldn't include the figure
```{r graphic , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='A cool graphic', out.width='25%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/hex-rmarkdown.png')
```

#### Generate data

```{r gen_x, echo=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 5, sd = 1)
```

```{r gen_y, echo=TRUE}
y <- 2 + 2 * x + rnorm(n = length(x))
```

```{r data plot, echo=TRUE}
plot(x, y, main = 'y = f(x)')
```

Include information between (x, y). LaTeX

Our response variable is $y$ is distributed $N(\mu, \sigma^2_y)$, where
\begin{align}
\mu &= 2 + 2*E[x] + E(e) \\
\sigma^2 &= 2^Var[x] + Var[e] + 2(2)Cov(x, e)
\end{align}
The `<&=>` sign aligns the equation by equals sign. `<\\>` signals new equation line.

We see that $\mu =$ `r mean(y)` and $\sigma^2 =$ `r var(y)`. Let's round the output.

$\mu =$ `r round(mean(y), 2)`

$\sigma^2 =$ `r round(var(y), digits = 2)`

Single equation in the center instead of in=line equations:
$$
y = f(x)
$$

# Working with Data

```{r data_import, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
df_all <- read_csv('data/daily_bike_data.csv')
dftemp <- df_all %>% select(cnt, temp)
```

```{r summary_stats, echo=TRUE}
ss_dftemp <- sapply(dftemp,
                    function(x) c(mean(x), min(x), max(x), sd(x))) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  round(digits = 2)

row.names(ss_dftemp) <- c('mean', 'min', 'max', 'sd')

ss_dftemp %>% knitr::kable(caption = 'Summary Statistics')
```

```{r data_vis, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(dftemp, aes(temp, cnt)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'Daily Bike Rental and Temp',
       x = 'Temperature (F, normalized)',
       y = 'Bike Rentals')
```

```{r data_mods, echo=TRUE}
dftemp <- dftemp %>% 
  mutate(temp2 = temp^2)

mod1 <- lm(formula = cnt ~ temp,
           data = dftemp)

mod2 <- lm(formula = cnt ~ temp + temp2,
           data = dftemp)

pred_mod1 <- predict(mod1, dftemp['temp'])

pred_mod2 <- predict(mod2, dftemp[c('temp', 'temp2')])

dftemp <- dftemp %>% 
  mutate(cnt_mod1 = pred_mod1,
         cnt_mod2 = pred_mod2)
```

```{r model_vis, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(dftemp, aes(temp, cnt)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(temp, pred_mod1), colour = 'red', size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(temp, pred_mod2), colour = 'blue', size = 1) +
  labs(title = 'Daily Bike Rental and Temp',
       x = 'Temperature (F, normalized)',
       y = 'Bike Rentals')
```
